# claude-latest-install.sh - Install bleeding-edge Claude Code via the official installer
#
# Idempotent: if ~/.local/bin/claude already resolves to a native install
# (symlink into ~/.local/share/claude/versions/), exit 0 without touching anything.
# Otherwise, run the official Anthropic installer from claude.ai/install.sh.
#
# Claude Code self-updates thereafter via `claude update`. This script is only
# responsible for bootstrapping a missing install (and forced re-install on demand).
#
# Invoked by:
#   - LaunchAgent (RunAtLoad=true, no-op normally) launched by ./latest.nix
#   - Manual `claude-latest-install` command (writeShellApplication on PATH)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Already installed (no-op) OR installer succeeded
#   non-zero - Installer failed (propagated from upstream)
