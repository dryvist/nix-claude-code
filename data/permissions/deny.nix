# Hard-denied actions and file-path patterns.
#
# ADMISSION BAR — a command belongs here only if it is potentially
# catastrophic: it costs real money, or it permanently destroys something
# that cannot be rebuilt or restored. Everything that is merely destructive
# but reversible (undo, re-clone, re-run, restore from git) belongs in
# allow.nix, not here.
#
# Deny is the ONLY restrictive tier. There is no `ask` tier — see ask.nix
# for why a prompt is an outage in an unattended run. That means every
# entry added here silently becomes an unconditional block, so the bar
# above is a hard gate, not a guideline.
#
# Two categories are policy rather than physics, and are deliberate:
#
#   git            — hook-bypass and history-corruption. Denied because the
#                    guard rails themselves are the target; an agent that can
#                    disable pre-commit or rewrite core.hooksPath can then do
#                    anything unobserved. Not reversible in the sense that
#                    matters: the damage is the missing check.
#   package-install — language-level package managers. Every environment here
#                    is defined by Nix (or Homebrew, or bun/bunx); an ad-hoc
#                    `npm install` / `pip install` mutates state that Nix
#                    believes it owns and that no rebuild will restore.
#
# Originally vendored from ai-assistant-instructions deny/*.json (snapshot:
# 2026-06-09, source rev 3128b52); re-derived against the bar above in the
# 2026-07 ask-tier removal.
